# INF Project 1: Word Puzzle Solver

## Project Description

This project is a Python-based word puzzle solver. It reads a puzzle and a list of words from a file, checks the consistency of the puzzle, and attempts to place the words onto the board following specific rules. The solver includes functions to create and print the board, identify word placements, check the validity of entries, and more.

### Key Features

- **File Reading**: Reads the puzzle and words from a specified text file.
- **Board Creation**: Creates and initializes the puzzle board.
- **Consistency Check**: Ensures the board is consistent in terms of dimensions.
- **Word Placement**: Identifies if a word can be placed on the board at a given position and direction.
- **Command Decomposition**: Parses user commands to determine coordinates, word number, and direction for word placement.
- **Board Printing**: Prints the board with coordinates for easier visualization.

## Usage

To run the solver, execute the `project1_bunyamin_berat_gezer_210102002061.py` file. Ensure that the input puzzle file is in the same directory or provide the correct path.

```bash
python project1_bunyamin_berat_gezer_210102002061.py
